# Library
My project is a library management window application. The project runs in GUI and the data of 
accounts, books and opinions are saved in a database by using SQLite. If the user has already 
logged into, he can do various things but it depends on whether he is a client or a librarian.
The client can view their borrowed books, add and display opinions about books. He/she can 
see available books and borrow them. The librarian has more options. He/she can add, delete, 
find or modify books in the database. It is the same with the user base. An interesting option is 
sending e-mails. Thanks to this method, the librarian can easily send information to clients.
